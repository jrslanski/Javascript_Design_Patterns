Motivation

Object creation logic becomes too convoluted.
Wholesale object creation can be outsourced to:
    - A separate method (Factory method)
    - That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
    - Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory


"A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise)
creation of objects."
