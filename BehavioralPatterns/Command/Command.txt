Motivation:

- Ordinary statements are perishable
    - Cannot undo member assignment
    - Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)

-Want an object that represents an operation
    - person should change its age to value 22
    - car should do explode(), who should we blame for this.

- Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and more.

Command: An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains
all the information necessary for the action to be taken.
