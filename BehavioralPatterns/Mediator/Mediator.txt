Facilitates communication between different components

Motivation:

- Components may go in and out of a system at any time.
    - Chat room participants
    - Players in an MMORPG

- It makes no sense for them to have direct references to one another
    - Those references may go dead

- Solution: have them all refer to some central component that facilitates communication.


** A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being
aware of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other.
