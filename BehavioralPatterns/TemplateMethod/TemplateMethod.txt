A high-level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors.

Motivation:
- Algorithms cab be decomposed into common parts + specifics
- Strategy pattern does this through composition
    - High-level algorithm uses an interface
    - Concrete implementations implement the interface

- Template Method does the same thing through inheritance
    - Overall algorithm makes use of empty ('abstract') members
    - Inheritors override those members
    - Parent template method invoked

Template method:
Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm, with concrete implementations
defined in subclasses.
