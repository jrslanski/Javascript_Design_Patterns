System behaviour partially specified at runtime.

Motivation:
- Many algoritms can be decomposed into higher- and lower- level parts
- The high-level algorithm can then be reused for making coffe or hot chocolate


Strategy:
Enables the exact behaviour of a system to be selected at run-time.
