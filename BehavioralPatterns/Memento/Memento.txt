

Motivation:

- An object or system goes through changes.
    - E.g., a bank account gets deposits and withdrawals

- There are different ways of navigating those changes

- One way is to record every change (Command) and teach a Command
to undo itself

- Another is to simply save snapshots of the system (Memento).


Memento: A token/handle representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state
when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.
