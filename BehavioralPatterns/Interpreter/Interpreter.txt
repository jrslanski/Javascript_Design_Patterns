Motivation:
-Textual input needs to be processed
-Some examples:
    - Programming language compilers, IDEs, etc.
    -HTML, XML, and similar
    - Numeric expressions

-Turning strings into OOP based structures in a complicated process.

Interpreter: A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into
separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens(parsing).
