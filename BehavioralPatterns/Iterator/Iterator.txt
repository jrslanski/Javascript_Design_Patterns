- Iteration is a core functionality of various data structures.
- An iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
    - Keeps a reference to the current element
    - Knows how to move to a different element

- Javascript supports this through:
    - Symbol.iterator member that returns
    - An iterator object with a function called next() that
    returns an object containing:
        - The value being iterated
        - The done flag indicating whether iteration is finished.
    - An interator object itself can also be made iterable.
