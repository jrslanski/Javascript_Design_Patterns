Motivation:

- Consider an ordinary telephone
- What you do with it depends on the state of the phone/line.
- Changes in state can be explicit or in response to events (Observer patterns)


State:

A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its sate. An object transitions
from one state to another (something needs to trigger a transition).

A formalized construct which manages state and transitions is called a state machine.
