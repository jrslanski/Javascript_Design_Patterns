Proxy: An interface for accesing a particular resource.

Motivation:
- You're calling foo.Bar()
- This assu,es that foo is in the same process as Bar()
- What if, later on, you want to put all Foo-related operations into a separate process
    - Can you avoid changing your code?
- Proxy to the rescue!
    - Same interface, entirely different behavior.

- This is called a communication proxy

PROXY: A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may
be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.
