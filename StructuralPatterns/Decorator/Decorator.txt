Decorator: Adding behaviour without altering the class itself.

Motivation:
 - Want to augment an object with additional functionality
 - Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)
 - Want to keep new functionality separate (SRP)
 - Need to able to interact with existing structures
 - Two options:
    - Inherit from required object (if possible)
    - Build a Decorator

Facilitates the addition of behaviours to individual objects without inheriting from them.
