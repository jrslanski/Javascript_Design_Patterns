Connecting components together through abstractions

Bridge prevents a "Cartesian product" complexity explosion.

Example:
    Base class ThreadScheduler
    Can be preemptive or cooperative
    Can run on Windows or Unix
    End up with a 2x2 scenario:
        WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS

Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion.


Bridge is a mechanism that decouples an interface(hierarchy) from an implementation(hierarchy).
