Facade: Exposing several component through a single interface.

Motivation:
-Balancing complexity and presentation/usability.
-Typical home:
    -Many subsystems (electrical, sanitation)
    -Complex internal structure.
    -End user is not exposed to internals.

-Same with software!

**Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.
