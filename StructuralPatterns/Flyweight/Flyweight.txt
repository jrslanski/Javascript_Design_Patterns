Flyweight: Is a space optimization technique.

- Avoid redundancy when storing data.
- E.g., MMORPG
    - Plenty of users with identical first/last names
    - No sense in storing same firts/last name over and over again
    - Store a list of names and references to them

- E.g., bold or italic text formatting
    - Don't want each character to have a formatting character
    - Operate on ranges (eg, line number, start/end positions)

A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing
externally the data associated with similar objects.
